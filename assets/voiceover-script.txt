Welcome to the Mentor-Protégé Program Portal — your gateway to transformative defense contracting partnerships.

Mentors shape careers through subcontracting partnerships, networking opportunities, and earning credit toward small business goals.

Protégés receive guidance from prime contractors in business development, technical capabilities, and federal procurement with hands-on support.

Join the annual MPP Summit where mentors and protégés connect to build relationships and discover new collaboration opportunities.
